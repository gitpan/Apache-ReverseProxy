NAME
       Apache::ReverseProxy - An Apache mod_perl reverse proxy

SYNOPSIS
        # In Apache config file
        <Location />
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::ReverseProxy
        PerlSetVar ReverseProxyConfig /usr/local/apache/conf/rproxy.conf
        </Location>

       # In rproxy.conf
        / http://www.cpan.org/

DESCRIPTION
       This is a reverse proxy module for Apache with mod_perl.
       It is intended to replace Apache::ProxyPass.  Given a list
       of URI mappings, this module will translate an incoming
       URI, retrieve the contents for the translated URI, and
       return the contents to the original requestor.  This
       module allows you to specify exact matching (instead of
       regular expression matching) and handles query string
       translations.

CONFIGURATION
       You will need to set the ReverseProxyConfig perl variable
       in Apache to the path of the reverse proxy mapping file.
       For example:

        <Location />
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::ReverseProxy
        PerlSetVar ReverseProxyConfig /usr/local/apache/conf/rproxy.conf

        # Optional configuration items:
        #PerlSetVar ReverseProxyChain http://proxy.mycompany.com:8888/
        #PerlSetVar ReverseProxyNoChain mycompany.com
        </Location>

       ReverseProxyChain specifies a proxy server to use.  This
       is sometimes called proxy chaining when one proxy server
       uses another proxy server.  The ReverseProxyNoChain
       directive can specify a domain to not use proxy chaining
       on.

       Reverse proxy configuration files have three fields, each
       separated by white space.  The first field is the uri to
       look for, the second field is the replacement uri, and the
       third field is optional and allows you to specify comma
       separated options for the mapping.  The only option that
       is currently supported is the exact parameter, which will
       make the reverse proxy use exact matching for the first
       parameter instead of using regular expressions.  This
       feature is convenient when the first parameter contains
       characters that may need to be escaped or quotemeta'ed.
       Exact options are evaluated first.  If there isn't an
       exact match, regular expression matches are performed.
       Configuration files may contain comments, which start with
       a pound sign.  For example:

        /news/ http://www.news.com/
        / http://www.perl.com/
        /stats http://localhost/stats exact
        # /stats maps exactly to http://localhost/stats
        # /stats/b maps to http://www.perl.com/stats/b
        /french/news http://www.news.com/?language=french
        # /french/news/index -> http://www.news.com/index?language=french
        # /french/news/index?a=b -> http://www.news.com/index?language=french&a=
b
